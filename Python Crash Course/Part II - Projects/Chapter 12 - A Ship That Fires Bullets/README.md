<h1>Chapter 12 - A Ship That Fires Bullets</h1>

<h2>12.1 Blue Sky</h2>
<p>
    Make a Pygame window with a blue background.
</p>

<h2>12.2 Game Character</h2>
<p>
    Find a bitmap image of a character you like or convert an image to a 
    bitmap. Make a class that draws the character at the center of the 
    screen, then match the background color of the image to the background 
    color of the screen or vice versa.
</p>

<h2>12.3 Pygame Documentation</h2>
<p>
    We're far enough into the game now that you might want to look at some 
    of the Pygame documentation. The Pygame home page is at  https://pygame.org, 
    and the home page for the documentation is at https://pygame.org/docs. 
    Just skim the documentation for now. You won't need it to complete this 
    project, but it will help if you want to modify Alien Invasion or make 
    your own game afterward.
</p>

<h2>12.4 Rockect</h2>
<p>
    Make a game that begins with a rockect in the center of the screen. 
    Allow the player to move the rockect up, down, left, or right using 
    the four arrow keys. Make sure the rockect never moves beyond any 
    edge of the screen.
</p>

<h2>12.5 Keys</h2>
<p>
    Make a Pygame file that creates an empty screen. In the event loop, 
    print the __*event.key*__ attribute whenever a __pygame.KEYDOWN__ 
    event is detected. Run the program and press various keys to see how 
    Pygame responds.
</p>

<h2>12.6 Sideways Shooter</h2>
<p>
    Write a game that places a ship on the left side of the screen and
    allows the player to move the ship up and down. Make the ship fire 
    bullet that travels right across the screen when the player presses 
    the spacebar. Make sure bullets are deleted once they disappear off
    the screen.
