<h1>Chapter 1 - Getting Started</h1>

<h2>1.1 Python.org</h2>
<p>
    Explore the Python home page (https://python.org/) to find
    topics that interest you. As you become familiar with Python, different parts of
    the site will be more useful to you.
</p>


<h2>1.2 Hello World Typos</h2>
<p>
    Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a
    typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo
    that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you
    make a typo that doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make an
    error?
</p>

<h2>1.3 Infinite Skills</h2>
<p>If you had infinite programming skills, what would you
    build? You’re about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind,
    you’ll have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to draft
    descriptions of what you want to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas”
