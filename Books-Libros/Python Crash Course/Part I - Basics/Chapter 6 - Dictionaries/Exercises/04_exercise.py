6.4 Glossary 2

Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code
from Exercise 6.3 (page 102) by replacing your series of print
statements with a loop that runs through the dictionary's keys and
values. When you're sure that your loop works, add five more Python
therms to your glossary. When you run your program again, these new
words and meanings should automatically be included in the output
