# How Do You Write Comments?

"""

In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following a
hash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter.
"""

# Say hello to everyone
print("Hello Python people!")

# What kind of Comments Should you Write?
"""
The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is
supposed to do and how you are making it work. When you’re in the middle
of working on a project, you understand how all of the pieces fit
together. But when you return to a project after some time away, you’ll
likely have forgotten some of the details.
